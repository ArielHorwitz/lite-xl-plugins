# Lite XL plugins

My own little plugins for the [Lite XL text editor](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl). Essentially another repo like the [official plugins](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-plugins) (see that repo for more detailed information).

### Install with plugin manager
If you have a Lite XL plugin manager, such as [`lpm`](https://github.com/adamharrison/lite-xl-plugin-manager),
add this repo by running:
```
lpm repo add https://github.com/ArielHorwitz/lite-xl-plugins:master
```
Then, install the plugins normally by running:
```
lpm install plugin_name
```

### Install manually
To install a plugin manually, drop the plugin file directly in:
* Linux `~/.config/lite-xl/plugins/`
* MacOS `~/.config/lite-xl/plugins/`
* Windows `C:\Users\(username)\.config\lite-xl\plugins\`
